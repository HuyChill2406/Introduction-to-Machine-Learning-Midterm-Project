# Introduction-to-Machine-Learning-Midterm-Project
Midterm project for the Introduction to Machine Learning course at Ton Duc Thang University. The project uses the Obesity Levels Dataset (from UCI) containing both numerical and categorical features to solve both classification and regression problems.

##Question 1: 
Performed statistical analysis and visualization, data preprocessing (type conversion, normalization), train/test split, and applied multiple ML algorithms for both classification and regression. Evaluated and compared methods using accuracy, error metrics, and visual charts.

##Question 2: 
Researched overfitting and implemented regularization techniques to mitigate it for selected models, then compared performance with and without overfitting solutions.

##Question 3: 
Applied feature selection using correlation analysis, retrained models with selected features, and compared the results.

Includes Python code in Jupyter Notebook, dataset
